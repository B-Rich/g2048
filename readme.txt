g2048: C++ Class for the 2048 game
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This Git hub repository contains a number of C++ modules, however, 
the one of primary interest is probably game2048 which is a C++ 
class for the 2048 game. Every attempt was made to make it as
portable as possible but since I spent almost no time on it take it
as is.  I included Borland C++ windows source which can be compiled
to make a windows native exe application for the game. There are no
rights reserved or anything else, it is all just for fun.
